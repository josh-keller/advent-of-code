Latern Fish
- spawn exponentially
- each one creates a new one once every 7 days
- model a fish as a single number (number of days until it creates a new fish)
- a new lanternfish needs slightly longer (+2 days for first cycle)

INPUT: a list of ints representing the days until a lanternfish spawns (spawns after day 0)
OUTPUT: the length of the list after 80 days

Take the initial state in an array of ints

For each fish:
  - If the fish is 0:
    - reset to 6 and append an 8 on the end
  - Else:
    - decrement the fish
