# Advent of Code 2021

I am currently learning Go so I thought it would be a fun challenge to do as
much of AoC2021 in Go as possible. Solutions here may be in collaboration with
others, especially my Launch School Capstone team. I will try to note where I
have collaborated and I will also not post any code that I didn't have a hand in
creating and/or do not understand.
