# Advent of Code

My repo for solutions for Advent of Code. Many of these are messy and were written quickly, but I like to keep them around for reference.

## 2019
Working on 2019 retroactively, in preparation for 2022.

## 2020
My first year participating. I had been learning Ruby for just a few months.

## 2021
Participated in AOC2021 just as I was learning Go, so I completed these challenges using Go. Lots of messy code as I was learning my way around the language and haven't had time to come back and refactor. Finished Day 19 in 2022, just before the next year's AoC.

## 2022
Decided to do it in TypeScript.
