1. Init an array for the results of reading the algorithm
2. Read the algorithm character by chacter:
   - if '#' -> 1
   - if '.' -> 0
   - if "\n" skip
3. Read the image into a slice of slices of bytes
4. Map the slice to another slice using binary numbers from neighbors function
5. Repad if necessary (only on even iterations?)


NEED:
- Function to get neighbor values and map to a binary number
- Function to pad the slice of bytes to ensure there are three dark pixels all
  around
- Function to display (0 -> '.', 1 -> '#')
