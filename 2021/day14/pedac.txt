- Read first line into a string 'polymer'
- Read next lines into a map


- FOR N steps:
  - Create a new string builder
  - FOR each byte from 0 to len - 2 in polymer:
    - Append byte i to the reader
    - Make a slice of byte i and i+1
    - Using that byte slice, check the map to see if there is another
      character to insert
    - If there is, insert it, otherwise, move on
  - Insert the last character
  - Set polymer = to the string representation of the builder

- Create a map from byte to int 'counts'
- Count the bytes in 'polymer'
- Find the max and the min
- Subratct min from max
