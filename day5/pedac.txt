- "vents" are line segments expressed as x1,y1 -> x2,y2
- Part 1: only consider vertical and horizontal (i.e. where x1 == x2 or y1 ==
  y2)
- 0,0 is top left
- x <->  y ^v

INPUT: List of lines (x1,y1 -> x2,y2)
OUTPUT: Number of points in the grid where at least two lines overlap

DATA:
- List of lines (a line is a pair of points or a list of points)
- 2d slice of ints indicating the number of vents present at each point

BIG STEPS:
- Parse the input file:
  - Split into lines
  - Make each line of input into a line segment (more on this later)
- Find the largest x and y values in the list
- Create a 2d slice of size x-max x y-max, initialize with all 0s
- Filter the list of lines to include only horizontal and vertical
- For each line segment, for each point in the segment, increment the point on
  the 2d array
- Count the number of points in the 2d slice that have a value > 1
